# Q) What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# A) Exception handling is the process in which we can control how our program handles errors/exceptions due to bad input, corrupted jobs, etc. 
# Instead of having the program stop completely, we can instead have it output some error message and continue on as needed.
